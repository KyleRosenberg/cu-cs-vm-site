## Flavors

The VM comes in a couple of flavors to accommodate various systems and
use cases:

- **XFCE x64** (Default): Most user should use this version.
- **XFCE x32**: For users who lack support for 64-bit VMs.
- **Unity x64**: For users who prefer the [Unity DE](https://unity.ubuntu.com/)
                 instead of the [XFCE DE](http://www.xfce.org/).
- **CSCI 1320 x64**: Same as the XFCE x64 flavor, with the
                     addition of a pre-installed copy of Matlab.

## Methods

The CU CS VM can be obtained via three methods:

- Download using [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)
- Download using [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
- Copy from a USB Flash Drive

If you're going to download the VM, we recommend using the BitTorrent
method: it is faster and less prone to errors than the HTTP method. To
use BitTorrent, you'll need to first install a **BitTorrent Client**. If
you do not already have a BitTorrent client installed, we recommend
[qTorrent](http://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) for OSX or
Windows, and [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) for
Linux.

To obtain a copy of the VM from a **USB Flash Drive**, please attend
your first-week recitation (CSCI 13XX, CSCI 2270) or one of the
[help sessions](#intro).
