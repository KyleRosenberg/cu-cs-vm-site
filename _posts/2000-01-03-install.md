## System Requirements

To run smoothly, the VM requires a minimum of:

- 4GB of RAM
- Intel Core i-series processor with
  [virtualization](http://ark.intel.com/Products/VirtualizationTechnology)
  support
- 2 physical processor cores
- 50GB of free HD space
- A modern 64-bit OS (Windows 7 or newer, OSX 10.7 or newer, or Linux 3.0 or newer)

## Install VirtualBox

The first step to installing the VM is to install
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This is the
[hypervisor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor) that we will use
to run the VM.

The VirtualBox installers for both OSX and Windows are included in the
[downloads](#obtain) above. Linux users should install VirtualBox via
their distribution's package management system. Alternatively,
installers can be obtained directly from the [VirtualBox
website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). This semester,
we'll be supporting **VirtualBox 5.0.12 or newer**. If you have an
older version of VirtualBox installed, you may update it in place by
downloading the latest version and installing it over your current
copy.

Full details for installing VirtualBox can be found in the [VirtualBox
docs](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch02.html). The basic steps
are listed below:

1. Locate the VirtualBox installer for your platform: `*.dmg` for OSX,
   `*.exe` for Windows
2. Click the installer to launch it
3. Follow the on-screen wizard's directions to complete the install process

## Import VM Image

Once VirtualBox has been installed, we need to import the CU CS VM
image. To complete this process:

1. Locate the VM image file: the `*.ova` file in the [downloads](#obtain) above
2. Launch VirtualBox (installed above)
3. From the VirtualBox top-bar menu, select `File > Import Appliance...`
4. In the `Import` window that pops up, use the file picker to select
   the `*.ova` VM image file from Step #1
5. Select `Next`
6. On the `Appliance Settings` screen, check the `Reinitialize the MAC
   address...` option
7. Select `Import`
8. Wait for the import process to complete: this may take 5 to 15
   minutes
9. When the import process has completed, you'll be returned to the
   main VirtualBox screen
