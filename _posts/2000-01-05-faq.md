If you encounter issues using the VM not addressed below, please
contact
[help@cs.colorado.edu](mailto:help@cs.colorado.edu). Alternatively, you
may visit any of the [CU CS
LA](https://foundation.cs.colorado.edu/la/) sessions or consult your
course staff.

## Questions

#### What is the username and password on the VM?

The default username:password combo is `user:user`. You may change
this password if you desire by running `passwd` from a terminal.

As on most Debian-based system, the root account is disabled. Use
`sudo` if you need to run privileged commands. 

#### How do I fix a VT-x/AMD-V error when trying to boot my VM?

If you receive an error message along the lines of:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
Failed to open a session for the virtual machine <VM Name>.

VT-x is disabled in the BIOS for both all CPU modes
(VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED).

Result Code:    E_FAIL (0x80004005)
Component:      ConsoleWrap
Interface:      IConsole {872da645-4a9b-1727-bee2-5585105b9eed}
{% endhighlight %}

Or any other error message mentioning **VT-x** or **AMD-V**, it
generally means VirtualBox is having trouble getting your processor to
support virtualization. This is normally due to one of the following
issues:

- Your machine supports VT-x/AMD-V, but it has been disabled in the
  BIOS
- Your machine does not support VT-x/AMD-V

To correct the former case, boot into your machine's BIOS and enable the
virtualization setting. The exact process for this differs by machine
(try Google or consult your machine's user manual), but the general
steps involve:

1. Shutdown your computer
2. Start your computer and select the appropriate key to enter the BIOS
setup menu (often F1, F2, F8, Del, Esc, or Enter)
3. Find the virtualization settings (often under security)
4. Change all virtualization-related features (e.g. VT-x, VT-d, AMD-V)
to enabled
5. Save your changes and reboot
6. Try launching the VM again

In the latter case (e.g. if you find no virtualization settings in
your BIOS), you may have to switch to using the 32-bit version of the
VM which is slower, but which does not require hardware virtualization
support.

#### Why is the network not working on the VM?

Did you recently update the VM? See
[https://github.com/asayler/cu-cs-vm-netfix](https://github.com/asayler/cu-cs-vm-netfix)
for the steps to fix the issue.
