## Questions

#### How do I fix a VT-x/AMD-V error when trying to boot my VM?

If you receive an error message along the lines of:

{% highlight text linenos=table %}
VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is not
operational. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and
will not be able to boot.

Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in the BIOS of
your host computer.
{% endhighlight %}

Or any other error message mentioning **VT-x** or **AMD-V**, it
generally means VirtualBox is having trouble getting your processor to
support virtualization. This is normally due to one of the following
issues:

- Your machine supports VT-x/AMD-V, but it has been disabled in the
  BIOS
- Your machine does not support VT-x/AMD-V

To correct the former case, boot it your machine's BIOS and enable the
virtualization setting. The exact process for this differs by machine
(try Google or consult your machine's user manual), but the general
steps involve:

1. Shutdown your computer
2. Start your computer and select the appropriate key to enter the BIOS
setup menu (often F1, F2, F8, Del, Esc, or Enter)
3. Find the virtualization settings (often under security)
4. Change all virtualization-related features (e.g. VT-x, VT-d) to enabled
5. Save your changes and reboot
6. Try launching the VM again

In the latter case (e.g. if you find no virtualization settings in your
BIOS), you may have to switch to using the 32-bit version of the VM
which does not require hardware virtualization support.
